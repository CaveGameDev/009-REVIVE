THIS VERSION IS HOSTED AT https://009-final.netlify.app


Long in progress browser remake of c0.0.9a, based off of real java source code.

Started roughly 7 months ago with a c0.0.12a remake, barely functional and now lost somewhere on my pc, 
eventually rebuild that into rd-131655, currently hosted at https://rd-cave.netlify.app/,
further built into rd-131648 or whatever, which is currently hosted at https://chipper-axolotl-2e7d02.netlify.app/.
Then I experimented with the steve model stuff but that never really worked.

This uses jszip to load assets from an ASSETS.zip, just because it is less files to upload.
Fixed particles kinda and minified from roughly 20 files to about 6, also added music.

-Originally Made at https://js-09.netlify.app/ (horrible)

-Working version of "Zombie" logic at https://0011a.netlify.app/

-Best Functional version (non minified) at https://tiny-biscochitos-ad028f.netlify.app/, also has 3rd person when pressing 5

=Made as an addition to https://js-launcher.on.websim.com/ (Please check out)

-Only remaining copy of the original c0.0.12a project currently at https://euphonious-sprite-e0831d.netlify.app/ (it really sucks)
