Long in progress browser remake of c0.0.9a, based off of real java source code.

Started roughly 7 months ago with a c0.0.12a remake, barely functional and now lost somewhere on my pc, 
eventually rebuild that into rd-131655, currently hosted at https://rd-cave.netlify.app/,
further built into rd-131648 or whatever, which is currently hosted at https://chipper-axolotl-2e7d02.netlify.app/.
Then I experimented with the steve model stuff but that never really worked.

This uses jszip to load assets from an ASSETS.zip, just because it is less files to upload.
